      [Opening volley of insults lambasting the character's performance and general life choices with theatrical disdain.]
  
      [Grudging acknowledgement of one positive moment or trait, undermined by a backhanded followup.]
  
      [Explanation for the score:
      - Adherence to the rules
      - Clever lateral thinking
      - Humorous moments
      - Overall effectiveness]
  
      [A parting shot insult issuing final judgement on both the performance and the character.]
