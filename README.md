# Preposterous Gauntlet

## Premise

Create characters, come up with strategies, and face funny challenges, all while getting roasted by a virtual host.

## Very serious technical details

I wanted to challenge myself to create an application which has no styling but takes ungodly amounts of RAM to run.

I wanted to use GPUs for jokes.

This runs a local language model.  This is like a 4GB file so give it a second to load.

Also, make sure you have at least 4GB of RAM free.
