# Preposterous Gauntlet

Create a character and compete in the Preposterous Gauntlet!

The game follows a series of steps for each episode:

1. **Character Creation**: The user creates a character by providing a name and description.
2. **Challenge Generation**: The OpenAI API generates an original challenge with rules and requirements.
3. **Strategy Formation**: The user comes up with a strategy for their character to tackle the challenge.
4. **Scene Generation**: The OpenAI API generates a script depicting the characters attempting the challenge based on their strategies.
5. **Critique**: The OpenAI API provides a critique of the characters' performances, complete with insults, backhanded compliments, and a final score.
