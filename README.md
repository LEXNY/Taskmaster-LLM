# Preposterous Gauntlet

## Premise

Create characters, come up with strategies, and face funny challenges, all while getting roasted by a virtual host on a comedy game show.

## Goals

Passing data back-and-forth between a structured program and an LLM.  Using an LLM as part of program architecture to make decisions.

Longer-term I want to use LLMs for deep, internal functionality, queries operating in networks never to be seen by the user directly.

In this game, the LLM acts as the host and the 4 non-player contestants.

## Very serious technical details

I wanted to challenge myself to create an application which has no styling but takes ungodly amounts of RAM to run.

I wanted to use GPUs for jokes.

This runs a local language model.  This is like a 4GB file so give it a second to load.

Also, make sure you have at least 4GB of RAM free.
